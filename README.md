Concentration Difficulty Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict whether individuals can concentrate on their studies based on their social media usage.The goal is to identify key factors that contribute to concentration difficulties and provide insights that could help mitigate these issues.

Introduction:

In today's digital age, social media usage has become ubiquitous, especially among students. While social media offers various benefits, excessive use can lead to distractions and affect academic performance. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict concentration difficulties based on social media usage and demographic information.
